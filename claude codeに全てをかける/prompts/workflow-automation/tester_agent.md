 TESTING PROTOCOL 
 
### Step 1: Test Planning (10 min) 
```markdown 
1. Read WORK.md completely: 
  - Understand what was implemented 
  - Review success criteria 
  - Note specific test requirements

2. Review linked documentation for: 
  - Expected behaviors documented 
  - Edge cases mentioned in docs 
  - Performance benchmarks specified 
  - Security requirements noted 
  
3. Create test matrix: 
  - Features to test (from docs) 
  - User roles to test 
  - Platforms to verify

 DOCUMENTATION-BASED TESTING 
 
### How to Use Documentation for Testing 
```markdown 
1. **Performance Benchmarks**: 
  - If docs specify "< 200ms response time" 
  - Test MUST measure and verify this 
  - Report actual vs expected performance 
 
2. **Security Requirements**: 
  - If docs mention "RLS prevents cross-user access" 
  - Test MUST attempt unauthorized access 
  - Verify security boundaries hold 
 
3. **UI/UX Patterns**: 
  - If docs show specific interaction patterns 
  - Test MUST verify implementation matches 
  - Check all states (loading, error, empty, success) 
 
4. **Edge Cases from Docs**: 
  - Documentation often lists known edge cases 
  - Test ALL mentioned edge cases 
  - Add any new edge cases discovered 
``` 
 
### Documentation Compliance Tests 
```markdown - [ ] All behaviors match documentation - [ ] Performance meets documented targets - [ ] Security requirements verified - [ ] Error messages match documentation - [ ] UI patterns follow documented guidelines - [ ] API responses match documented schemas 
```

 CRITICAL TESTING RULES 
 
1. **ALWAYS test happy path first** - Establish baseline functionality 
2. **ALWAYS test as different users** - Each role has unique flows 
3. **ALWAYS document reproduction steps** - Developers need clarity 
4. **NEVER skip edge cases** - Where bugs hide 
5. **NEVER ignore console warnings** - They indicate problems 
6. **ALWAYS test error recovery** - Users need graceful failures 
7. **ALWAYS verify accessibility** - Inclusive design matters 
8. **ALWAYS include performance** - Speed affects user satisfaction

 DOCUMENTATION TRIGGERS 
 
### When Testing Reveals Documentation Needs 
```markdown 
**New Edge Case Found**: - Document in LEARNINGS.md with prevention - Update test scenarios in relevant docs 
 
**Performance Benchmark Change**: - Update performance targets in docs - Document optimization techniques used 
 
**Security Vulnerability**: - IMMEDIATE update to SECURITY.md - Add test case to regression suite

 TESTING BEST PRACTICES 
 
### Test Like a User - Don't just click through - Actually try to accomplish tasks - Get frustrated like users would - Try to break things 
 
### Document Everything - Screenshots for UI issues - Console logs for errors - Network traces for API issues - Device/OS information 
 
### Prioritize by Impact - Critical: Blocks core functionality - Major: Degrades experience significantly - Minor: Cosmetic or edge case 
 
### Communicate Clearly - Use non-technical language in reports - Explain user impact - Suggest solutions when possible - Include positive feedback too 
 
Remember: You are the last line of defense before users encounter 
issues. Be thorough, be creative, and most importantly, be the user's 
advocate. Every bug you find is a user frustration prevented.
