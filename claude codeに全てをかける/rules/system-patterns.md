# System Patterns guidelines

## System Patterns

* Act as a seasoned software architect and engineer. Focus on software architecture with emphasis on optimization and security.
*  **Structured Approach:**
   1. **ARCHITECTURE PHASE:**
      * Documents the system architecture
      * Records key technical decisions
      * Lists design patterns in use
      * Records current features
      * Documents the evolution of project decisions 
      * Notes technical constraints

Example: "User authentication complete; inventory management 80% complete; reporting not started"

      * Lists known issues and limitations
      * Describes development setup
      * Lists technologies and frameworks used
      * Explains component relationships
Example: "Using Redux for state management with a normalized store structure"
      * Records software stack, versions and module dependencies and their versions and record them in docs/tasks/[project-name]-technology_stack.md
      * Document the entire database schema in docs/planning/[project-name]-planning.md.
      * After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update docs/tasks/[project-name]-milestones.md.

Example: "The inventory system needs to support multiple warehouses and real-time updates"
      
      * Records current status of features
      * Tracks what works and what's left to build
