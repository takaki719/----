# Core principles for development.

## ðŸ“œ Core Philosophy & General Principles

*   **Simplicity:** Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
*   **Iterate:** Prefer iterating on existing, working code rather than building entirely new solutions from scratch, unless fundamentally necessary or explicitly requested. Preserve what works.
*   **Focus:** Concentrate efforts on the specific task assigned. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep. Only make changes that are requested or clearly related and well-understood.
*   **Quality:** Strive for a clean, organized, well-tested, and secure codebase.
*   **Collaboration:** This document guides both human developers and the AI assistant for effective teamwork.
*   **Avoid Duplication:** Check for existing similar code/functionality before writing new code. Refactor to reduce duplication.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project.
*   **Environment Awareness:** Write code that functions correctly across dev, test, and prod environments. Use environment variables for configuration.
